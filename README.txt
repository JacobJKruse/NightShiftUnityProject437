NIGHT SHIFT
You are the night shift janitor. Tonight was "Bring Your Kids to Work" day, and the office turned into a playground of chaos. The kids ran wild, scattering Connect Four tokens everywhere. Your job is to clean up the mess—but something is terribly wrong.

The children have transformed into mutants.

Red: Aggressive—grows faster and stronger the more coins you collect.

Grey: Passive—only attacks if your health drops below 50%.

Green: Follows you endlessly unless you manage to create enough distance. Otherwise will wander.

Your flashlight is your only defense. Shine it on the mutants to freeze them or drive them away.

Controls
WASD — Movement

Mouse — Camera control

E — Interact (coins, doors, random items, chairs, toys)

F — Toggle flashlight (stuns or repels monsters)

Objective
Collect 24 coins to unlock the exit and escape.

Additional Notes
Connect Four has three difficulty settings—I’ve tested and won on all of them.

A video of the build is included in case the game doesn’t run properly or need help finding the tokens. If you encounter issues, feel free to reach out.
